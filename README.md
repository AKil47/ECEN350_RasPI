# ECEN 350 Labs

These were the labs that I did in ECEN 350 during Fall'23. These labs are designed to run on a **Rasperry PI** (or really anything with an ARM processor)

The labs are divided into two main sections:

- ARM Assembly Labs (Lab 1 - 5) - Different labs that has us writing ARM assembly.

- Verilog CPU Labs - Labs where we built different components of a CPU before ultimately combining them together into a fully functional CPU.

**This repo contains answers to lab assignments for ECEN 350**. Since this repository is a fork of the main repository that we get the starter code from, I am unable to make this repo private. I encourage active students to seek help from the TAs (like I did) instead of copying from here.

## Things to Look For

The hope is that this repo will serve as a reference in the future if I ever do anything related to assembly/verilog. Some of the cool things that I did are:

- Writing in ARM assembly
  - Doing math operations
  - Moving data into registers and memory
  - Calling functions (manipulating SP, calling conventions, etc)
  - Recursion
- Bridging assembly code to C (using compiler/linker)
- Writing makefiles
  - The `makefile` for Lab 9 is completly custom. The other ones were just modified
- Writing in Verilog
