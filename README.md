# ECEN 350 Labs

These were the labs that I did in ECEN 350 during Fall'23. These labs are designed to run on a **Rasperry PI** (or really anything with an ARM processor)

The labs are divided into two main sections:

- ARM Assembly Labs (Lab 1 - 5) - Different labs that has us writing ARM assembly.

- Verilog CPU Labs - Labs where we built different components of a CPU before ultimately combining them together into a fully functional CPU.
